# 6 Reasons why a "Github Project" is a WEAK criterion

1. If you pay someone to write code, that code is your **property and shouldn't be shared online for anyone to download**
2. Any software built specifically to give *your* business a competitive edge over other businesses ought to remain undisclosed
3. Only a developer with 0 clients will have the time to sit down and work on big projects just to show you how well they can code
4. Any client THAT worried about code quality should consider milestones, and if the code isn't up to par, they end up losing little
5. If a developer doesn't provide high-quality alternatives for you to evaluate (eg. case studies, reviews), then just don't hire them
6. Is going through a large project's source code really less taxing than casually reading a well-written, well-laid-out case study?
